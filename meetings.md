### Action Items
1. wireframes - incorporate real feeds

## Sept 11th

### Location

### Agenda
  - Use Case
  - Brainstorm Funcionalities/Features: User and System

### Notes
#### Random Thoughts
  - Triggio should be a social conversation starter. It should promote social interactions between people as a by-product instead of through the program. It is very powerful because it can create a source of interaction that is intergrated with people's lives.

#### Functionalities/Features: User

**Log-in**
  1. Easiest way to log-in: open it when the computer starts. EX: like Dropbox
  2. Go to Triggio.com - login page, allow users to save account info. EX: like Facebook
  3. Log-in through work email only. EX: desk.com

**Sign-up**
  1. One person in the company signup with work email ONLY
  2. May send invite link to people he thinks should join. EX: desk.com
  3. With invite link: sign up with email (work ideally) so say "work email" instead of "email"
  4. Without invite link: MUST use work email. send a confirmation email to validate the account.

**Capture Attention**
  1. Sounds - always on
  2. ~Person's name - maybe apply it to other people in the company. EX: Draco did x.....~
  3. pop-ups on computer - annoying if coming up every minute; *to think about: summarize updates every x period*
  4. images (more than words) - maybe for summaries/trends, OCCASIONALLY; EX: Graphs on daily sales, everyday at x time;
  5. Contrast - design

Notification
- Sound focused - sounds should be unique
- option to turn off sound on the native app

Feed
- on the native app or on website
- mixed of text and images - skip image (sept 15th)
- option to replay the sound
- when the notification is made
- Source of notification - changed to type
- No Scrolling

Features to Implement:
  1. summarize information on the feed
  2. integrations: Salesforce
  3. Admin account for changing sounds
  4. option to upload sounds through all accounts
  5. User driven data

Idea Bucket:
- Allow people to "favour/like" events. Popular events will reply if there is enough demand 
- click on events to get more summary/information 
- Colour code feeds (EX: colour code for good or colour code for bad)
